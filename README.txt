  2.Mesh Warping[1]

   The mesh-warping algorithm relates features with nonuniform mesh in the
   source and destination images, i.e., the images are broken up into
   small regions that are mapped onto each other for the morph.

   The algorithm accepts a source image, a destination image and two 2D
   arrays of coordinates. The first array, S, specifies the coordinates of
   control points in the source image. The second array, D, specifies
   their corresponding positions in the destination image. Both S and D
   must have the same dimensions in order to establish a one-to-one
   correspondence.

   Then two imges are processed through 2-pass warping with 2 output
   intermediate images I1 and I2. The first pass is responsible for
   resampling each row independently. It maps all initial image points
   coordinates (u, v) to their (x, v) coordinates in the intermediate
   image , thereby positioning each input point into its proper output
   column.The second pass then resamples each column in intermediate
   image, mapping every (x, v) point to its final (x, y) position in
   I1/I2. The 2D arrays in which the control points are stored to impose a
   topology to the mesh.

   More detail is that each frame in the transformation uses an
   interpolated mesh M as the set of target positions for the input mesh
   points. M is computed by performing linear interpolation between
   respective points in S and D. The "warp" program actually plays an
   important role here since both I1 and I2 are each warped using M as the
   target mesh. Thus, I1 is warped using meshes S and M. In addition, I2
   is warped using meshes D and M. Now that the landmarks of the source
   and target images are aligned, they are cross-dissolved to generate a
   morph frame. Catmull-Rom cubic spline is used to implement bicubic
   interpolation in [3] because it offers local control, although any
   spline wourld suffice.

   Pros and Cons:

                                     Pro

                                     Con

     * Fast and intuitive
     * Efficient algorithms exist for computing the mapping of each pixel
       from the control grid

     * Trying to position dozens of mesh points around is like trying to
       push a rope; something is always forced where you donâ€™t want it to
       go.
     * The animator must specify in advance how many control points to use
       to control the image, then take those given points and move them to
       the correct locations.
     * Points left unmodified or points for which the animator could not
       find an associating feature are still used by the warping
       algorithm.

  3. Feature-Based Image Morphing [2]

   The field morphing algorithm uses lines to relate features in the
   source image to features in the destination image. It is based upon
   fields of influence surrounding two-dimensional control primitives. It
   applies the reverse mapping as its ways of warping.

   [ Note: There are 2 ways to warp an image. The first, called forward
   mapping, scans through the source image pixel by pixel, and copies them
   to teh apprpriate place in the destination image. The second, reverse
   mapping, goes through the destination image pixel by pixel, and samples
   the correct pixel from the source image. The most important feature of
   inverse mapping is that every pixel in the destination image gets set
   to something appropriate. In the forward mapping case, some pixels in
   the destination might not get painted, and would have to be
   interpolated.]

    Transformation between one pair of lines

   A pair of lines (one defined relative to the source image, the other
   defined relative to the destination image) defines a mapping from one
   image to the other.

   [img019.jpg]
   where u is the position along the line, and v is the distance from the
   line [image2.jpg]

   The algorithms transforms each pixel coordinate by a rotation,
   translation, and/or a scale, thereby transforming the whole image.

    Transformation between multiple pairs of lines

   Normally there are many features in images where transformation between
   multiple pairs of lines are applied. It specifies more complex
   transformations. A weighting of the coordinate transformations for each
   line is performed. The weight is determined by the distance from X to
   the line.

                                [image4.jpg]

   [image3.gif] where length is the length of a line, dist is the distance
   from the pixel to the line, and a, b, and p are constants that can be
   used to change the relative effect of the lines

   The multiple line algorithm is as follows:

     For each pixel X in the destination
     DSUM=0
     weightsum = 0
     For each line PiQi
     calculate u, v based on PiQi
     calculate X i based on u, v and P iQ i
     calculate displacement Di=X i-Xi for this line
     dist= shortest distance from X to PiQi
     weight = (lengthP / (a + dist))b
     DSUM += Di * weight
     weightsum += weigth
     X = X + DSUM / weightsum
     destinationImage(X) = sourceImage(X)

    Process of Morphing between Two images

     * Define corresponding lines in source image I0 and destination image
       I1.
     * Each intermediate frame I of the metamorphosis is defined by
       creating a new set of line segments by interpolating the lines from
       their positions in I0 to the positions in I1.
     * Both images I0 and I1 are distorted toward the position of the
       lines in I. These two resulting images are cross-dissolved
       throughout the metamorphosis.

                Destination Image

   [image1.jpg]  Left figure is the first face distorted to the
                 intermediate position without the grid or lines.
   [image12.jpg] Same as above figures with lines drawn over the faces.
   [image3.jpg]  Left figure is the second face distorted to the
                 intermediate position without the grid or lines.
   [image44.jpg] Same as above figures with lines drawn over the faces.
   [image5.jpg]  Left figure shows the morphed image (right figure) with
                 the interpolated lines drawn over it.

    Advantage and disadvantage

                                 Advantages

                                Disadvantages

   The only positions that are used in the algorithm are ones the animator
   explicitly created. Everything that is specified is moved exactly as
   the animator wants them moved, and everything else is blended smoothly
   based on those positions.
     * Speed problems: All line segments need to be referenced for every
       pixel. The runtime is proportional to the number of lines times the
       number of pixels in the image.
     * Control: Between the lines, sometimes unexpected interpolations are
       generated.
